# Simulations

You discussed simulations at length in [Lecture 04](https://raw.githack.com/edrubin/EC607S24/master/notes-lecture/lec04/notes.html#1), but in general simulations are a useful tool for understanding estimators' behaviors

Today we are going to discuss how to simulate data and test the reliability of estimators


## Random Variables in R

First, we should become familiar with how we can generate data. To do this, we will need to know how R handles random numbers. 

In Base R, the following common random number distributions can be generated using the following functions:

* Binomial: *rbinom(N, x, p)*

  - $N$ trials, outcome is either $x$ or $0$, and it yields $x$ with the probability $p$
  
* Normal: *rnorm(N, mean = $\mu$, sd = $\sigma$)*

  - $N$ trials, each drawn from $N(\mu, \sigma)$, i.e. the distribution is mean $\mu$ and has *standard deviation* $\sigma$
  
* Uniform: *runif(N, min, max)*

  - $N$ trials, each drawn from $U(min,max)$


Let's try an example:

#### Exercise 1: Generate 100 samples of outcomes from the following distribution and graph these as a density plot:

$$N(3,2) + U(-1,1)$$

```{r exercise 1}

# Grab 2 packages
library(pacman)
p_load(tidyverse, ggplot2)

# Generate in a tibble
ex_1_data = tibble(
              obs = rnorm(100, mean = 3, sd = 2) + runif(100, min = -1, max = 1)
)


# Basic graph
ggplot(ex_1_data) +
  geom_density(aes(obs))


# Let's make it look nicer!
ggplot(ex_1_data) +
  # fill the density plot
  geom_density(aes(obs), fill = "lightblue") +
  # vertical line where the mean is
  geom_vline(xintercept = 3)


```




## Seeds?

You may have seen the term "seed" around when it comes to generating random numbers on a computer. 

A "seed" initializes a pseudorandom number generator. This allows your results to be replicated elsewhere. Try it out:

```{r seed}

# Set seed
set.seed(90325) # button mash

# Generate some numbers
rnorm(10, 0, 3)



# Do it again:
set.seed(90325) 
rnorm(10, 0, 3)

```

Another fun exercise would be to find out what the probability of getting these exact numbers twice without re-setting the seed... But we won't do that now. 



## Tibble as a Function

We already saw 1 way to implement the *tibble* function to generate random data. Now let's do that within a function. This function will generate a dataframe of:

* $N$ observations 

* $ID_i = i$ numbers the observations

* $X_i = N(10, 2)$

* $Z_i = U(-3,3) - 0.2*X_i$

* $\varepsilon_i = N(0,1)$

* $Y_i = \alpha + \beta X_i + \delta Z_i + \varepsilon_i$

For now, keep $N, ~ \alpha, ~ \beta$ and $\delta$ as variables that we can change.


```{r function}

# Data generating function
data_gen = function(N, alpha, beta, delta) {
  
  # create the dataset
  data = tibble(
    ID = 1:N,
    X = rnorm(N, mean = 10, sd = 2),
    Z = runif(N, min = -3, max = 3) - 0.2*X,
    e = rnorm(N, mean = 0, sd = 1),
    
    # create Y as a function of other variables
    Y = alpha + beta*X + delta*Z + e
  )
  
  return(data)
}


```

Try with the following parameters:

$$N = 1000, ~~~ \alpha = 4, ~~~ \beta = 1/2, ~~~ \delta = 2$$
```{r test 2}

test_data = data_gen(N = 1000, alpha = 4, beta = 0.5, delta = 2)

head(test_data)

```



## Simulate Regressions

Create a function that simulates the data above (with the same parameters) $100$ times, each time performing the following regression:

$$Y_i = a + bX_i + cZ_i$$

Collect the estimates for $b$.

```{r sim 1}

# Grab some packages
p_load(fixest, broom)


# regression simulation, function of the number of iterations
reg_sim = function(iter){
  
  # get data 
  data_i = data_gen(N = 1000, alpha = 4, beta = 0.5, delta = 2)
  
  # regression
  reg_i = feols(data_i, Y ~ X + Z)
  
  # Clean a bit
  bind_rows(tidy(reg_i)) %>% 
      # only want the estimate of b
        filter(term == "X") %>%
      # grab the estimate
        select(2) 
}


# Simulate for 100 periods
iter = 100

results_1 = bind_rows(map(1:iter, reg_sim))


```


Now plot the density of the estimates from the results of the simulation

```{r graph}

# Plot
ggplot(results_1) +
  # fill the density plot
  geom_density(aes(estimate), fill = "red", alpha = 0.5) + # alpha makes it see-through!
  
  # recall that the true Beta = 0.5
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.5)

```



## Omitted Variable Bias

Do the same simulation from the previous part but this time only estimating the regression:

$$Y_i = a + b X_i$$
```{r ovb}

# Omitted Variable Bias Regression
reg_sim_2 = function(iter){
  
  # get data (same)
  data_i = data_gen(N = 1000, alpha = 4, beta = 0.5, delta = 2)
  
  # new regression
  reg_i = feols(data_i, Y ~ X)
  
  # Clean a bit
  bind_rows(tidy(reg_i)) %>% 
      # only want the estimate of b
        filter(term == "X") %>%
      # grab the estimate
        select(2) 
}


```


Simulate the full regression model and the OVB simulation 1000 times each and graph the estimates for $b$ on the same density plot

```{r sim 2}

# 1000 periods
iter = 1000


# Full regression
results_full = bind_rows(map(1:iter, reg_sim))

# OVB regression
results_ovb = bind_rows(map(1:iter, reg_sim_2))


# Graph
# Plot
ggplot() +
  # Full reg estimates
  geom_density(aes(results_full$estimate, fill = "Full Model"), alpha = 0.5) + 
  
  # OVB estimates
  geom_density(aes(results_ovb$estimate, fill = "Omitted Variable"), alpha = 0.5) +
  
  # true Beta = 0.5
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.5) +
  
  # Label
  labs(x = "Estimate of Beta") + 
  
  # Fill colors
  scale_fill_manual(name = "", values = c("red", "green")) +
  
  # Legend position
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```


You can estimate the mean of the biased estimator:

$$E(b^{OVB}) = \beta + \delta \frac{cov(X,Z)}{var(X)} = 0.5 + 2 \frac{-0.8}{4} = 0.1$$


### T-Stats OVB Simulation

Run the simulation again, except this time grab the t-stat on the coefficient on $X$

**First** recreate the simulation function, as *1 function*

```{r t stat sim}

# Full Model Regression Simulation
reg_t_sim = function(iter){
  
  # get data 
  data_i = data_gen(N = 1000, alpha = 4, beta = 0.5, delta = 2)
  
  # regressions
  reg_full = feols(data_i, Y ~ X + Z) # full regression
  reg_ovb = feols(data_i, Y ~ X)  # OVB regression
  
  # Clean a bit
  bind_rows(tidy(reg_full),tidy(reg_ovb)) %>% 
        filter(term == "X") %>%
      # t-stat is the 4th term
        select(4) %>%
      # name whether estimate came from full or ovb regression
        mutate(OVB = c("No", "Yes"))
}



```


**Second:** iterate this 1000 times

```{r t sim 2}

# 1000 periods
iter = 1000

# Run Simulation
results_t_sim = bind_rows(map(1:iter, reg_t_sim))


```


**Third:** Graph!

```{r t sim graph} 

ggplot(results_t_sim) +
  geom_density(aes(statistic, fill = OVB),
               stat = "density", position = "identity", alpha = 0.5)

```

**Fourth:** (optional) make it look nice :)

* Let's make the full model density red, the OVB density green

* Shade in the area where we fail to reject the null hypothesis $H_0: \beta = 0$

```{r t sim 4}

ggplot(results_t_sim) +
  
  # Same as before
  geom_density(aes(statistic, fill = OVB),
               stat = "density", position = "identity", alpha = 0.5) +
  
  # Change colors
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Omitted Variable?", values = c("red", "green")) +
  
  # Shade region (basically a rectangle)
  annotate("rect", xmin = -1.96, xmax = 1.96, ymin = 0, ymax = 0.4, 
           alpha = .5) +
  
  # Name "fail to reject" region.
  annotate("text", x=-2, y=0.4, hjust=0, vjust=-.25, size=3, label = "Fail to Reject") +
    # hjust and vjust adjust the text's relative position to the coordinates
  
  # Labels
  labs(x = "t-statistic") +
  
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")


```
