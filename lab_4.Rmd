# Why Visualize Data?

In an age of big data, it can be difficult to accurately convey a narrative through presenting plain numbers in tables

On the flip side, there are **BAD** ways to visualize that data

Let's create a list of axioms or goals that we want to stick to when creating data visualizations that help us convey what we want to be conveyed. Our goals:

* Be clear and concise (avoid over-complicating the figure)

* Accurately represent the data (use the *right* type of graph)

* Be purposeful (avoid doing things because it *looks neat*)

* Others?


# Types of Visualizations

Here are a list of different types of graphs often used to express data (these are hyperlinks):

* Most common: [Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_chart), [Scatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot), [Bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_chart)

* Less common: [Density / Histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram), [Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot), [Pie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_chart), [Sankey](https://sankeymatic.com/)

* Rare: [Waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_chart), [Radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart), [Pareto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_chart) (these are mostly stylistic variations or combinations of the above graphs, and are often pointless)



### *Which do I use?*

* Non-answer: It depends on the data!

# GGPLOT2

R's best friend for data visualization is the package *ggplot2*

```{r ggplot2 load}

library(pacman)
p_load(ggplot2)

```


### Line Chart

In general, the code for line charts will look like:

```{r ggplot template, eval=F}

ggplot(dataset, aes(x = x_variable, y = y_variable)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "x variable label", y = "y variable label", title = "Graph title") +
  theme()

```




Let's graph the unemployment data over time, using 

```{r unemployment}

# Load package and data
p_load(readr)

url_time = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ojetton/Econometrics_Lab_Spring_24/main/time_data"

time_data = read_csv(url(url_time))


# Graph:
ggplot(time_data, aes(x = date, y = UNRATE)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Unemployment Rate (%)", title = "US Unemployment Rate Over Time") +
  theme_bw()

```

There are a lot of options we have for adjusting this visualization. Suppose we want:

* The y-axis to span from 0 to 15

* The line to be dashed instead of solid

* The line to be blue

* Try theme_dark()

```{r un plot 2}

# Graph:
ggplot(time_data, aes(x = date, y = UNRATE)) +
  
  # Changes to the line are within the "geom_line" function
  geom_line(linetype = "dashed",
            color = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Unemployment Rate (%)", title = "US Unemployment Rate Over Time") +
  
  # Change the y-limits
  ylim(0,15) + 
  
  # Try a new theme!
  theme_dark()

```

Is this a *better* data visualization? Admittedly, no... 

### Multiple Lines

Let's graph the unemployment rate (in percent) and the inflation rate (in percent)

```{r multiple lines}

# Plainly:
ggplot(time_data, aes(x = date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = UNRATE)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = INF))


```

Let's add some detail:

```{r multiple lines 2}

ggplot(time_data, aes(x = date)) + # SAME x variable
  
  # Separate "geom_line" for each variable
  geom_line(aes(y = UNRATE, color = "blue")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = INF, color = "red")) + # COLOR within aes()
  
  labs(title = "Unemployment and the Inflation Rates",
       x = "Date", y = "Percent") +
  
  # Legend:
  scale_color_identity(
      name = "",
      guide = "legend",
      labels = c("Unemployment Rate", "Inflation Rate")) +
  theme_bw() +
  
  # Position of legend
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```

Notice:

* the colors are listed *within* the aes() function

* scale_color_identity() gives details in the legend. name = "" yields no name, as it's unnecessary here

* theme(legend.position = "bottom") is *after* theme_bw(), doing it the other way around won't work




### Scatter

Let's graph the unemployment rate *against* the inflation rate (the Phillips Curve)

```{r scatter}

# geom_point()
ggplot(time_data, aes(x = UNRATE, y = INF)) +
  geom_point()

```

Problems start to arise when there are three variables. One common way to introduce a third variable is with *color* or *size*. Suppose we want to show what the effective federal funds rate was in these data points:

```{r color and size}

# Color
ggplot(time_data, aes(x = UNRATE, y = INF)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = FEDFUNDS))

# Size
ggplot(time_data, aes(x = UNRATE, y = INF)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = FEDFUNDS))

```




### Bar Graph

Grab the **space_data** from the GitHub page

```{r bar}

# planets
url_space = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ojetton/Econometrics_Lab_Spring_24/main/space_data"

space_data = read_csv(url(url_space))

ggplot(space_data, aes(x = Body, y = Volume)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")


```

Yikes... Let's clean this up. And

```{r bar 2}


ggplot(space_data, aes(x = reorder(Body,Volume), y = log(Volume))) +
  # Color for the type of celestial body
  geom_bar(aes(color = Type), stat = "identity") + 
    # replace "color" with "fill" for different look
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Celestial Body", y = "Log of Volume in Billions of Cubic Kilometers") +
  theme_minimal()

```

### Pie Chart

```{r pie}

ggplot(space_data, aes(x="", y = log(Volume), fill=Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=1) +
  coord_polar("y") +
  theme_void()


```
