```

## The Challenge:

Write a function that uses a Riemann Sum to correctly estimate $\pi$ to at least 5 correct decimals: $3.14159$

Ideally, you are combining your knowledge of algebra, geometry, and R loops to estimate $\pi$.

You may *not* use any packages outside of base R, or any trigonometric functions or other pre-existing R functions that have $\pi$ *baked* into them.
